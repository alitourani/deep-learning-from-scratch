# Machine Learning Samples

**Machine Learning** refers to the process of learning AI rules by analyzing collections of known examples. Deep Learning is actually is a sub-section of ML algorithms that needs to be told about the essential features. Before starting implementing some DL networks, here we work on some simple ML approaches.
