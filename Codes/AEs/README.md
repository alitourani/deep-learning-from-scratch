# Autoencoders (AEs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)

Autoencoders are deep neural network architectures used for **Feature (representation) Learning** in unlabeled data. The goal in an AE is to leverage NNs for representation learning. Autoencoders reconstruct the input approximately by keeping only the most relevant parts of data.
