# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

CNNs (ConvNets) utilize the mathematical foundation of convolution for computer vision tasks. Inspired by the organization of the Visual Cortex, CNNs can provide much lower pre-processing comparing to other classification algorithms. These networks can automatically learn the filters and characteristics of the input images. In contrast with regular NNs, the layers of a CNN have neurons arranged in three dimensions: width, height, depth.
