# Deep Q-Networks (DQNs)

Reinforcement Learning is the usage of DNNs to interact with real dynamic environments and training models to make a sequence of decisions. A Deep Q-Network is a common architecture for RL. The main goal in DQNs it to provide a cheat sheet for the agent to find the best action! DQNs are used to approximate the Q-value function, where the input is current (candidate) state, and the output is the Q-value of all possible actions
